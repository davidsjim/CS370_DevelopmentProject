README
======

this package includes the following files.
Makefile
|-- Cipher.cpp --|  methods defined from Cipher.h
|-- main.cpp --|  main part to create the ciphered text and send it to specified outputfile
|-- Cipher.h --|  defines methods to be used for Cipher.cpp
|-- README.txt --|  this Text file
|--WordBank--| Example Wordbank file !!! Each String Should be seperated with a new charachter delimeter !!!
|--Keyfile--|Example Keyfile !!!! IMPORTANT The key file MUST BE length 8 bytes for BLOCK CIPHER (8 chars) !!!!

the executable name is Cipher 
First use  make to create the executable Cipher
Make clean to clear the executable and .o files


there are 7 main functions ReadInput ,ReadKeyfile , WriteToFile , Blockcipher , StreamCipher , Decipherblock  , DecipherStream.

the error messages are clear however ignore the usage error about sacrificing a goat.

1st argument that gets passed is EITHER "B" or "S" Representing BLock cipher or Stream Cipher 

2nd argument is the wordbank name  
3rd argument is the outputfile name to write the encryption and 
4th argument is the Keyfile where the string that will XOR the actual wordbank words for Encryption.


for the swap part the pointers point at the begining and the end of the full string.
